# Ames-Housing-Dataset-Model-Buliding

• Performed data cleaning, feature selection and data analysis on various parameters affecting house sale prices

• Implemented Linear Regression, GLM, Classification Tree, Random Forest and Neural Network algorithm models

• Compared the error rates for all the models and predicted house sale prices for the validation set with minimum errors


When constructing models, these are the percentage mean prediciton errors(PMPE: Difference in predicted sale prive and sale price in percentage) for the four models

1)Linear Regression Model : PMPE= 7.81%

2)Neural Network Model: PMPE= 8.34%

3)Random Forest Model : PMPE= 6.959%

4)Generalised Linear Model : PMPE= 6.999%
